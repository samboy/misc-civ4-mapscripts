This is a quick and dirty modification to the Archipelago map script which 
comes with Civ4.  This script, instead of generating a bunch of islands 
in an ocean, generates a bunch of areas with arable land in a desert (or
snow, or coast for a Polynesian experience).

This is geared towards desert-themed mods (since as Legends of Ancient 
Arabia), but works with other mods for games where people do not want to 
build a navy, but want to retain a "needle in a haystack" exploration 
flavor.

To install, put the script in ${Beyond the Sword}\PublicMaps (or 
${Warlords}\PublicMaps or even ${Civ4}\PublicMaps), Note that 
${Beyond the Sword} is where BTS is installed 
(such as c:\Program Files\2K Games\Civilization IV Complete\Beyond the Sword 
or what not), ${Warlords} is where Warlords is installed, and where ${Civ4} 
is where vanilla Civ4 is installed.  It may also work if ${Beyond the Sword} 
is ${My Documents}\My Games\Beyond the Sword\PublicMaps (or likewise for 
${Warlords} and ${Vanilla}).

To use, keep in mind that lowering the "sea level" increases the size
of areas with arable land.  I like the map with a low "sea level" and
with an "arid" climate.

This script has only been tested in Warlords using the Legends of Ancient 
Arabia mod.  Your mileage may vary.
